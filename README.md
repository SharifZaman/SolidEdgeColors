Solid Edge Helper - Change Part Colors Quickly

I've used a few programs written by others and I wanted to give back and share this COLOR app I've started. I wanted to get it finished with many other features, but if I wait I'll never get it out there. It works best in Assembly. Select a part, then click the color. It will change all like parts to that color unless you select Selected Part Only. Color Copy - select two+ parts, 1st color is selected to all others. If only one part selected, it copies color to rest of identical parts. Clears - Used same color but makes clearer - best if you change to one of these colors 1st then Clear. It will add the color to the Styles and you can see there. Also you will see the txt file of colors, you can edit there too. Features to come - easier way to make your own color tables, rename Shades by right click, and more. I did this in ST9. Not tested in later versions. Feed back is cool - I'd like to hear any new features to add. reposition the sub forms and then close it. Next time it will be in new position. 
This is my very 1st time sharing - I'll see how much feed back then decided on how far to take the documentation and helpers and adding menus and other info. I was trying to make it without need for instructions - we'll see!
